This is a balanced 5x speed modification for Stellaris. "Balanced" means that all aspects of the game have been accelerated, so game experience is really just faster, but not distorted.

[i]As of now, credit for the latest and all coming updates goes to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/oldent/]OldEnt[/url] (development takes place on [url=https://github.com/OldEnt/stellaris-on-speed]his GitHub[/url]). Thank you so much! The initial version had been developed by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/schreon]schreon[/url].[/i]

[b]If you are running any other mods with Stellaris on Speed this mod should always be at the top so other mods can overwrite it if necessary.[/b]

You can play the game at "normal" or even "slow" - the game progress is still quite fast. This also means that players with a weak system or a bad Internet connection can now enjoy the whole game, even on a large map in endgame.

How does this sorcery work? Well, the trick is that this mod accelerates everything 5x: ship speeds, growth rates (or rather: it divides growth cost by 5), production, upkeep, effect / edict durations, terraforming speed, army damage, ship damage, etc etc. That way, the game needs less "game ticks" (= simulation steps) in order to make the same progress as in vanilla.

The problem with vanilla "fast" or "fastest" setting is, that the game is accelerated by computing more game ticks per minute. Thus, the maximum speed you can achieve is naturally limited by both your system capabilities and your internet connection (in case of multiplayer). With this mod, during 1 game tick the game progresses like in 5 vanilla game ticks.

This also means that production, upkeep, fleet strength as well as army strength appear as 5x. However, be assured: The relative balance of Stellaris has not been touched. The only thing you have to get used to are the higher numbers.

What does happen if I still set up "fast" or "fastest"? Well, that is insanely fast then ... Go try it ;)

I want to keep this mod plain vanilla, so it serves all people who just want to enjoy the game faster, without too many changes to the actual game. I will also provide optional mods based on this one which also improve gameplay by balancing the game mechanics in Stellaris.

Is this compatible to other mods? Well, this is a problematic point. In order to achieve 5x speed, I had to touch a lot of game files. Also, I have no control over build times, production and upkeep of pop jobs / buildings that other mod makers add to the game. This means, you will probably be able to combine this mod with a lot of other mods, but modded buildings will be built very slowly, relatively speaking. This could be easily fixed if we were able to agree on a common way on how we (the mod makers) handle build time / production / upkeep values. If mods are structured in a certain way, it will be easy for me to release small compatibility patches for each mod out there. However, as far as I can see, almost no mod is doing that right now. I will reach out to other mod makers in the future and ask them if they want to enable their mod to be accelerated by "Stellaris on Speed" ;)

Stay tuned and please file bugs in the comment section or add me on steam. I am very happy for any feedback. Cheers :)
